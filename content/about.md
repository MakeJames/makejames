Hi, I'm James.

I am a musician, coder, and scrum master and I like to make things.

Through my career, I have had the privilege of working on diverse transformational projects across the public and third sectors. From leading the implementation of innovative solutions to driving data-driven decision-making, I have honed my skills and gained invaluable experiences that have shaped me both professionally and personally.

When not empowering teams to work more effectively together, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, exploring innovative solutions, or mentoring others. I aim to foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and cross-sector partnerships. Together, we can drive positive change and create a more inclusive and accessible digital solutions.

Feel free to check out the rest of my website and discover more of my projects and journey towards better, more efficient, inclusive solutions for all.
